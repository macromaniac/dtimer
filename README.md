# dtimer

small timer i use for counting down days to complete tasks

syntax is eg ".\dtimer.exe 2" to countdown 2 days, can do ".\dtimer.exe 'do laundry' 2" to set a timer with a goal, or ".\dtimer.exe" to recall the last used timer

you can put the exe in the startup dir (run command-> shell:startup ->enter) if you want to be reminded everytime you log into your computer of some task
